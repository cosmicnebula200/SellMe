# The configuration for each message of SellMe

# Use & instead of double S for a quicker colorizing of texts
prefix: '&l&d[SellMe]'

# seperator seperates the message from the prefix
# Format looks like:
# {prefix} {seperator} {message}
# the spaces are automatically added so you dont have to worry about that too :))
seperator: '&e=> &b'

# The placeholders which you can use are
# {COUNT} =>  Number of items (hand, all)
# {ITEM} => Item Name which is sold (hand, all)
